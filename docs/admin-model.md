# Admin Model

Marvin implements a comprehensive role-based authorization system with two distinct levels:
1. **Platform-level roles** - Control access to platform-wide operations
2. **Workspace-level roles** - Control access within specific workspaces

## Platform Roles

Platform roles determine a user's access to platform-level operations. Each user has exactly ONE platform role.

### PlatformRole Enum

```python
class PlatformRole(Enum):
    NONE = "NONE"           # Standard user (no platform privileges)
    SUPER_ADMIN = "SUPER_ADMIN"  # Platform administrator
```

### SUPER_ADMIN (Platform Administrator)

A **Super Admin** has unrestricted platform-level privileges across all workspaces.

**Permissions:**
- View and manage all workspaces (not limited by workspace membership)
- Create/edit/delete workspaces
- Manage workspace settings for any workspace
- Manage users across the platform
- Access all publishing configurations
- Perform platform-level operations

**Access:**
- Can bypass workspace membership checks (configurable per-endpoint)
- Access admin routes under `/api/admin/*`
- Full access to user management operations

**Notes:**
- Super admins are rare - typically only the platform owner/operators
- Should be reserved for platform administrators only
- Can optionally be required to have explicit workspace membership for sensitive operations

### NONE (Standard User)

Standard users with no platform-level privileges.

**Characteristics:**
- Default for all regular users
- Must have explicit workspace membership to access workspace content
- Cannot perform platform-level operations
- Access controlled entirely by workspace roles

## Workspace Roles

Workspace roles determine what a user can do within a specific workspace. Users can be members of multiple workspaces with different roles in each.

### WorkspaceRole Enum

```python
class WorkspaceRole(Enum):
    OWNER = "OWNER"      # Workspace owner (highest privilege)
    ADMIN = "ADMIN"      # Workspace administrator
    EDITOR = "EDITOR"    # Content editor
    AUTHOR = "AUTHOR"    # Content author
    VIEWER = "VIEWER"    # Read-only viewer
```

### Role Hierarchy

Roles follow a privilege hierarchy where higher roles include all permissions of lower roles:

```
OWNER (5) ≥ ADMIN (4) ≥ EDITOR (3) ≥ AUTHOR (2) ≥ VIEWER (1)
```

### OWNER

Full control over the workspace.

**Permissions:**
- Everything an ADMIN can do
- Transfer ownership (future)
- Delete the workspace (future)

**Typical Use:**
- One OWNER per workspace
- Creator of the workspace

### ADMIN

Workspace administrator with management capabilities.

**Permissions:**
- Manage workspace settings
- Manage workspace members (invite/remove)
- Manage entry types and collections
- Create/edit/delete all entries
- Manage assets
- Configure publishing (API clients, site settings)

**Typical Use:**
- Workspace administrators and managers
- Users who need full workspace management capabilities

### EDITOR

Content editor who can manage all content.

**Permissions:**
- Create entries
- Edit all entries (not just their own)
- Upload and manage assets
- Organize content into collections

**Cannot:**
- Manage workspace settings
- Invite/remove users
- Configure publishing

**Typical Use:**
- Content editors
- Users who need to manage content but not workspace settings

### AUTHOR

Content author who can create and manage their own content.

**Permissions:**
- Create entries (owned by them)
- Edit their own entries
- Upload assets

**Cannot:**
- Edit others' entries
- Manage workspace settings
- Invite users

**Typical Use:**
- Content contributors
- Guest authors
- External collaborators

### VIEWER

Read-only viewer.

**Permissions:**
- View published content
- View workspace content they have access to

**Cannot:**
- Create or edit content
- Manage anything

**Typical Use:**
- Read-only stakeholders
- External reviewers
- Note: For true read-only external access, use API clients instead

## Database Schema

### Users Table

```python
class Users(SqlAlchemyBase):
    # Platform role (one per user)
    platform_role: Mapped[PlatformRole] = mapped_column(
        SqlAlchemyEnum(PlatformRole),
        nullable=False,
        default=PlatformRole.NONE,
    )
    
    # Legacy group association (DEPRECATED - use workspace_memberships)
    group_id: Mapped[GUID] = mapped_column(GUID, ForeignKey("groups.id"))
    
    # Workspace memberships (many-to-many via WorkspaceMembers)
    workspace_memberships: Mapped[list["WorkspaceMembers"]] = orm.relationship(...)
    
    # DEPRECATED fields (kept for backward compatibility)
    admin: Mapped[bool | None]  # DEPRECATED: Use workspace roles
    is_superuser: Mapped[bool]  # DEPRECATED: Use platform_role
    can_manage: Mapped[bool | None]  # DEPRECATED: Use workspace roles
    can_invite: Mapped[bool | None]  # DEPRECATED: Use workspace roles
```

### WorkspaceMembers Table

Junction table tracking user-workspace relationships with roles.

```python
class WorkspaceMembers(SqlAlchemyBase):
    id: Mapped[GUID] = mapped_column(GUID, primary_key=True)
    user_id: Mapped[GUID] = mapped_column(GUID, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    group_id: Mapped[GUID] = mapped_column(GUID, ForeignKey("groups.id"))
    workspace_role: Mapped[WorkspaceRole] = mapped_column(
        SqlAlchemyEnum(WorkspaceRole),
        nullable=False,
    )
    
    # Unique constraint: one membership per user-workspace pair
    __table_args__ = (
        UniqueConstraint("user_id", "group_id", name="uq_workspace_member"),
    )
```

## Authorization Helpers

### Platform-Level Authorization

```python
from marvin.core.dependencies.dependencies import (
    get_current_superuser,  # Original name (backward compatible)
    get_platform_admin,     # New alias (clearer naming)
)

# Require platform admin
@router.post("/api/admin/workspaces")
async def create_workspace(
    user: PrivateUser = Depends(get_platform_admin)
):
    # Only SUPER_ADMIN can reach here
    ...
```

### Workspace-Level Authorization

```python
from marvin.core.dependencies.dependencies import (
    require_workspace_owner,
    require_workspace_admin,
    require_workspace_editor,
    require_workspace_author,
    require_workspace_viewer,
    require_workspace_member,
)

# Require ADMIN role or higher
@router.put("/api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/settings")
async def update_settings(
    workspace_id: UUID4,
    user: PrivateUser = Depends(require_workspace_admin())
):
    # Only ADMIN or OWNER can reach here
    # Platform admins can bypass (default)
    ...

# Require EDITOR role or higher
@router.post("/api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/entries")
async def create_entry(
    workspace_id: UUID4,
    user: PrivateUser = Depends(require_workspace_editor())
):
    # EDITOR, ADMIN, or OWNER can reach here
    ...

# Block platform admin bypass for sensitive operations
@router.delete("/api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/permanent-delete")
async def permanent_delete(
    workspace_id: UUID4,
    user: PrivateUser = Depends(
        require_workspace_admin(allow_platform_admin=False)
    )
):
    # Platform admins need explicit ADMIN role
    ...
```

### Custom Role Requirements

```python
from marvin.core.dependencies.dependencies import require_workspace_role
from marvin.db.models.users.roles import WorkspaceRole

@router.post("/api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/drafts")
async def create_draft(
    workspace_id: UUID4,
    user: PrivateUser = Depends(
        require_workspace_role(WorkspaceRole.AUTHOR)
    )
):
    # AUTHOR, EDITOR, ADMIN, or OWNER can reach here
    ...
```

## User Model Helper Methods

### Platform Admin Check

```python
user = await get_current_user(...)

# Check if user is platform admin
if user.is_platform_admin:
    # User has SUPER_ADMIN platform role
    ...
```

### Workspace Role Check

```python
# Get user's role in a workspace
role = user.get_workspace_role(workspace_id)
if role == WorkspaceRole.ADMIN:
    # User is admin in this workspace
    ...

# Check if user has at least a specific role
if user.has_workspace_role(workspace_id, WorkspaceRole.EDITOR):
    # User is EDITOR, ADMIN, or OWNER
    ...
```

## Implementation Patterns

### Group Scoping

All workspace-scoped resources use these patterns:

```python
# Repository layer - scoped by group_id
repos = get_repositories(session, group_id=current_user.group_id)
entry = repos.entries.get_one(entry_id)  # Automatically scoped

# Direct queries - manual filtering
entry = session.query(Entries).filter(
    Entries.group_id == current_user.group_id,
    Entries.id == entry_id
).first()
```

### Admin Routes vs Publishing Routes

**Admin Routes** (`/api/admin/*`, `/api/entries`, etc.):
- Require user authentication (JWT token)
- Check workspace membership and roles
- Return all entry states (draft, review, published)
- Include admin metadata (created_by, internal notes, etc.)
- Write operations allowed based on role

**Publishing Routes** (`/api/publish/{workspace_slug}/*`):
- Require API client token authentication (`marvin_sk_*`)
- Scoped to workspace associated with the API client
- Only return `status = 'published'` entries
- Exclude all admin fields
- Read-only operations only

### Site Client Permissions

Site clients (API tokens for publishing) are:
- Scoped to one workspace
- Read-only (cannot create/edit/delete)
- Can only see published content
- Cannot impersonate users or access admin APIs

See: `docs/site-clients-and-publishing.md`

## Migration Path

### From Boolean Flags to Roles

The migration (`3dd1c8a4ed25_add_role_based_authorization.py`) automatically:

1. **Platform roles**: Converts `is_superuser=True` to `platform_role=SUPER_ADMIN`
2. **Workspace memberships**: Creates workspace_members records for all users
   - `admin=True` → `WorkspaceRole.ADMIN`
   - `admin=False` → `WorkspaceRole.AUTHOR`
3. **Preserves legacy fields**: `admin`, `is_superuser`, etc. kept for backward compatibility

### Deprecated Fields

These fields are deprecated but preserved for backward compatibility:

| Field | Replacement | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| `admin` | Workspace roles (ADMIN, etc.) | DEPRECATED |
| `is_superuser` | `platform_role` | DEPRECATED |
| `can_manage` | Workspace roles | DEPRECATED |
| `can_invite` | Workspace roles | DEPRECATED |
| `can_organize` | Workspace roles | DEPRECATED |
| `advanced` | Workspace roles | DEPRECATED |

### Migration Strategy

**Phase 1: Coexistence** (Current)
- New role system active
- Legacy fields preserved
- Both systems work in parallel
- New code uses roles, old code uses flags

**Phase 2: Gradual Migration**
- Update routes one-by-one to use role-based dependencies
- Test each migration
- Keep deprecated dependencies available

**Phase 3: Deprecation Warnings**
- Log warnings when legacy fields are used
- Update documentation to recommend new approach
- Migration guide for custom code

**Phase 4: Removal** (Future)
- Remove deprecated fields from database
- Remove old dependency functions
- Clean up migration code

## Default Seed Data

### Admin User (Production)
- **Username**: admin
- **Platform Role**: `SUPER_ADMIN`
- **Workspace Role**: `OWNER` in default workspace
- Full platform and workspace access

### Development Users (Non-Production)

| Username | Platform Role | Workspace Role | Use Case |
|----------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| jason    | NONE         | ADMIN          | Workspace administrator testing |
| bob      | NONE         | EDITOR         | Content editor testing |
| sarah    | NONE         | AUTHOR         | Content author testing |
| sammy    | NONE         | VIEWER         | Read-only viewer testing |

## Security Principles

1. **Default to workspace scoping**: All queries should filter by `group_id` unless explicitly platform-level
2. **Workspace isolation**: Never leak data between workspaces
3. **Least privilege**: Assign minimum required role
4. **Explicit authorization**: Check workspace membership and role before any operation
5. **Platform admin bypass optional**: Sensitive operations can require explicit membership
6. **Separate concerns**: Admin routes and publishing routes use different auth mechanisms
7. **Role hierarchy**: Higher roles include all lower role permissions

## Error Responses

### Not a Platform Admin
```json
{
  "detail": "Super admin privileges required. This operation requires platform-level access."
}
```
Status: `403 Forbidden`

### Not a Workspace Member
```json
{
  "detail": "Access denied. You are not a member of this workspace."
}
```
Status: `403 Forbidden`

### Insufficient Role
```json
{
  "detail": "Access denied. Required role: ADMIN, your role: EDITOR"
}
```
Status: `403 Forbidden`
