"""Action-executor registry for Flavor B automations.

Each action `kind` registers an executor here; the engine dispatches by kind. Mirrors
OPERATION_REGISTRY / TOOL_REGISTRY. Flavor B is NOT AI-specific — the engine and most executors have
no AI dependency; the `operation` kind is the only AI-coupled one, and it's reachable only when an
automation names an AI operation (and AI is enabled + the `automation` source is allowed).

Executor contract:
    execute(session, group_id, action: dict, context: dict, *, user_id=None,
            authorizer_role=ROLE_OWNER, dry_run=False) -> dict
`context` carries {event, entry?, previous, depth}. `authorizer_role` is the *current* numeric role
of the automation's author — the authority the action runs under (definer's rights, see authz.py);
executors gate their privilege against it. When `dry_run` is True the executor still gates + resolves
its inputs (interpolation, target lookup) but does NOT execute — it returns a preview of what it
*would* do instead of performing it. Return a dict (becomes `$previous` for the next step). Raise
:class:`AutomationActionError` on any failure — the engine logs and stops that pipeline.
