"""Per-action authorization for Flavor B automations — *definer's rights*.

An automation is workspace config that only an ADMIN/OWNER may author (creation is role-gated in the
controller). So its actions run under the **author's** authority (``WorkspaceAutomationModel.created_by``),
NOT under whoever happens to trip its trigger. The triggering ``user_id`` is provenance only.

Without this, ``user_id`` was threaded as ``triggered_by`` but never checked, so an operation's
``min_role`` (and the implicit privilege of a handler/webhook action) was *silently unenforced* for
automation-run actions: an AUTHOR publishing an entry could trip an admin-authored automation that
runs a privileged reindex/rebuild handler or exfiltrates workspace data to a webhook, all under full
workspace authority.

This module resolves the author's **current** role at execution time and gates each action against
the role it needs. The check is fail-*closed*: if the author was demoted or removed, the privileged
actions their automation used to be allowed to run now fail cleanly (the engine logs + records it)
rather than continuing to run with stale authority.
