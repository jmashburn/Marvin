"""Per-trigger condition-field catalog + coherence validation for Flavor B automations.

The matcher context differs by trigger: an entry-lifecycle event exposes ``entry.*``, an incoming
webhook exposes ``event.payload.*``, a chained trigger exposes ``event.automation_slug``, and so on.
Conditions are authored as free-text dotted paths, so it is easy to reference a namespace the
trigger never provides — e.g. ``entry.entry_type`` under an ``incoming_webhook`` trigger — which
then *silently never matches* (the path resolves to None). This module:

  * advertises the fields available per trigger (``condition_field_catalog``) so the builder can
    offer a guided picker instead of a blank text box, and
  * validates a definition (``validate_definition``) and returns human-readable issues, so the same
    mismatch surfaces as a warning at author time rather than a workflow that quietly does nothing.

Validation is advisory (warnings), not a hard gate: payload shapes are caller-defined and advanced
authors may map fields the catalog can't know about. The engine remains the source of truth for
execution; this only helps authors avoid the silent-no-op footgun.
