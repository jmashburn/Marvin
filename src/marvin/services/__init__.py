"""
This module serves as the entry point for the `marvin.services` package.

It defines the `BaseService` class, which provides common functionalities and
attributes (like logger, settings, and directory configurations) intended to be
inherited by all other service classes within this package. This promotes
consistency and reduces boilerplate in concrete service implementations.

    A base class for all service layer classes in the Marvin application.

    This class provides common attributes that services might need, such as:
    - A logger instance for logging messages.
    - Access to application settings (`AppSettings`).
    - Access to application directory configurations (`AppDirectories`).

    Services inheriting from `BaseService` will automatically have these
    attributes initialized and available for use.
