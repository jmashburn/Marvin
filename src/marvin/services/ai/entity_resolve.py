"""Shared entity-resolution helpers for the AI controller and tool handlers.

Both the operations controller and the core tool handlers need to (a) accept a UUID *or*
a slug for an entity id (MCP/CLI callers work in slugs) and (b) map retrieved RAG chunks
back to their entity + resolved title for citations. These live here so both import them
rather than reaching into the controller.
