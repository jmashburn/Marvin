"""System workflow collections.

Every workspace gets a small set of **system** collections that mirror the entry review
pipeline: Inbox → Drafts → Needs Review → Approved → Archive. They are:

- **smart** — membership is derived from entry status (see smart_collections), so entries move
  between them automatically as they progress;
- **system** (`is_system=True`) — locked from edit/delete (workflow infrastructure);
- **internal** (`is_public=False`) — never exposed via the publish API.

Seeding is idempotent (keyed on group_id + slug), so it is safe to run on every startup and for
each newly-created workspace.
