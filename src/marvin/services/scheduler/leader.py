"""Decide which process runs the scheduled callbacks.

The scheduler starts in every API process's lifespan. With more than one replica — the production
chart values ask for two — every replica ran the minutely callbacks, so `post_group_webhooks`
delivered each webhook once per replica and `check_scheduled_tasks` triggered each due task once
per replica.

Leadership is a lease on a single database row. A process may run a tick only while it holds an
unexpired lease, and the holder extends it on every tick. If the holder dies, the lease lapses and
another process claims it on its next tick, so leadership recovers on its own within
``LEASE_TTL_SECONDS``.

The claim is a conditional UPDATE, so the database decides the winner: two processes racing on the
same row both issue an UPDATE guarded by the same predicate, and only one reports a row changed.
No advisory locks, which keeps this working on SQLite as well as Postgres.
