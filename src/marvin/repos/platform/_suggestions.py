"""Shared AI write-back staging for entity repositories.

Any repo whose model has a `suggestion_json` column (entries, assets, resources) mixes this in to
get the stage / apply / clear trio. `apply_fields` — how a proposed {target: value} map is written
onto the entity — stays per-repo, since targets differ (a tag junction, a JSON path, a column).
