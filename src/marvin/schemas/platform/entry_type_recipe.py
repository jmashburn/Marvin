"""Entry type authoring recipe.

Where `schema_json` defines the *fields* (the form) and `capabilities_json`/`rendering_json`
define *output* behaviour/render, `recipe_json` defines the *authoring* contract — what to
gather and derive to build an entry of this type:

- assets: how many images, per-role limits (hero/gallery/thumbnail), what to derive from each
- resources: entities to extract from content into linked resources (e.g. suppliers)
- enrichment: AI/media steps the recipe runs on compose

v1 is intentionally permissive (extra fields allowed) while the shape settles. Roles use the
same vocabulary the renderer already reads (hero/featured/gallery/thumbnail).
