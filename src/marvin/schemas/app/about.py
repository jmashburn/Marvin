"""
This module defines Pydantic schemas for application-level "about" information
within the Marvin application.

These schemas are typically used as response models for public or user-facing
endpoints that provide general details about the application, its version,
theme, and certain configuration statuses.

Note: Some model names in this file (e.g., `AppInfo`, `AppTheme`, `AdminAboutInfo`,
`CheckAppConfig`, `AppStatistics`) overlap with those in `marvin.schemas.admin.about`.
The definitions here might be intended for different contexts (e.g., less detailed
views for non-admin users) or could indicate a need for consolidation if they
serve identical purposes. This documentation reflects the models as defined in this specific file.
