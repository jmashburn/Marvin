# Lessons

## Environment / tooling

- **Always run Python through the project venv in `Marvin/`.** Use `uv run python …`
  (or `uv run <tool>`) rather than bare `python`/`pip`. The repo is a uv project; bare
  `python` uses the system interpreter and misses installed deps. Correction from user
  2026-07-17.

## Database migrations

- **Never hand-write Alembic migration files.** Always generate them through Alembic's
  autogenerate process so revision IDs, `down_revision` chains, and schema diffs are correct.
  Use the repo task: `task py:migrate -- "message describing the change"`
  (wraps `uv run alembic --config src/marvin/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate -m "..."`).
  Review/adjust the generated file, but do not author migrations by hand. Correction from
  user 2026-07-17.
  - **Reinforced 2026-07-19** (repeated the mistake): always generate via the command so the
    revision id is unique and `down_revision` auto-resolves to the current head. Hand-*picking* a
    revision id collided with an existing one (`b1c2d3e4f5a6`) and produced an Alembic
    "cycle detected" that broke the whole test suite. Always verify `alembic heads` shows ONE head.
  - **CORRECTED 2026-07-20 — the "autogenerate is unreliable on SQLite" claim was FALSE.**
    I repeated it from memory and used it to justify hand-filling migration bodies; the user
    pushed back ("it's always worked for me") and was right. Autogenerate was never the problem:
    **six models used the Postgres-only `postgresql.JSONB` type**, which SQLite cannot compile, so
    every run died with `UnsupportedCompilationError`. Fixed at the source — those models now use
    `sa.JSON`, and `task py:migrate` runs clean against the SQLite dev DB.
    - **Rule: use `sa.JSON` for JSON fields, regardless.** Not `postgresql.JSONB`, and don't
      re-pitch `sa.JSON().with_variant(JSONB, "postgresql")` — that was raised and declined.
    - **Meta-lesson:** when a memory says a standard tool is "broken", verify it before repeating
      it, and prefer fixing the cause over enshrining the workaround. A stale workaround cost more
      than the one-line fix would have.

## Git in this repo

- **Never run `git stash` (or any committing git command) here.** Commit signing is enabled, so
  `git stash push` creates a signed commit → invokes GPG/pinentry to decrypt the user's `pass` key
  → hangs the non-interactive session (and pops an unexpected passphrase prompt at the user).
  This is the same trap already known for `git push` (memory `git-push-needs-gpg-unlock`), but it
  bites on *stash* too, which is easy to reach for.
  - **Instead**, to compare working-tree changes against committed state, use read-only plumbing:
    `git show HEAD:<path>` (diff it against the working file), `git diff`, or copy the HEAD version
    to a temp file. Never mutate the index/worktree to "test something and put it back".
  - Correction from user 2026-07-20: a `git stash push`/`pop` round-trip to check whether
    `astro check` errors were pre-existing triggered their GPG pinentry and wedged the shell for
    two tool calls. The same question was answerable with `git show HEAD:<file>`.

## sa.JSON + Python None = JSON `null`, not SQL NULL

- **Trap:** a `mapped_column(sa.JSON, nullable=True)` column renders Python `None` as the JSON
  literal `null` (a real, non-NULL value), *not* SQL `NULL`. So `column IS NOT NULL` matches every
  row ever set to `None` — insert-time defaults *and* explicit `obj.col = None` clears.
- **How it bit us (2026-07-22):** the dashboard "pending AI suggestions" count queried
  `suggestion_json IS NOT NULL` across entries/assets/resources and reported **111** when the real
  count was **0** — all 111 rows held JSON `null` from `clear_suggestion()` doing `obj.col = None`.
- **Fix:** `mapped_column(sa.JSON(none_as_null=True), nullable=True)` makes `None` → SQL NULL, for
  both inserts and clears. Plus a data migration (`9f3e7a1c8b2d`) to normalize existing
  `suggestion_json::text = 'null'` rows to real NULL (dialect-guarded: `::text='null'` on PG,
  `= 'null'` on sqlite).
- **Rule:** any `sa.JSON` column that is nullable *and* ever queried with `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL`
  must use `none_as_null=True`. Otherwise the "is it set?" check is silently always-true.

## Alembic revision ids must be globally unique

- Hand-authored migrations reuse cute sequential ids (`a1b2c3d4e5f6`, `b2c3d4e5f6a7`, …). Picking
  `a1b2c3d4e5f6` for a new migration **collided** with an existing one → `alembic upgrade` failed
  with "Cycle is detected in revisions". Grep `src/marvin/alembic/versions/` for your chosen id
  before using it; pick something random (e.g. `9f3e7a1c8b2d`).

## `pgrep` is aliased to `pass grep` in this shell — DO NOT run bare pgrep

- The user's bash snapshot (sourced by Claude Code, `expand_aliases` on) defines
  `alias pgrep='pass grep'`. It's the *only* `pass` alias that shadows a real binary.
- Running `pgrep ...` (intending the process tool) executes `pass grep`, which greps the
  **decrypted** password store and prints matching entries **with secret values**. GPG is often
  already unlocked mid-session, so it dumps silently. This leaked real tokens into a transcript.
- **Rule:** never call bare `pgrep` in Bash here. Use `command pgrep` / `\pgrep` / `/usr/bin/pgrep`,
  or find processes via a `/proc/*/cmdline` scan or `ps`/`ss` (all unaliased and safe). `pkill`,
  `kill`, `ps`, `grep`, `ss` are NOT aliased.
- Correction from user 2026-07-22: using `pgrep -f 'src/marvin/app.py'` to find the backend pid
  dumped their pass store (GitHub/GitLab tokens, Bitwarden entries) into command output.
