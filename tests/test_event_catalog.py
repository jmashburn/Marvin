"""Honesty guard for the event catalog.

The Events UI advertises events users can subscribe to. Advertising an event that nothing ever
dispatches is a lie — the subscription can never deliver. These tests scan the source for real
`EventTypes.X` references and assert the *subscribable* catalog only contains events with an emitter,
so the ~40 dead events stay gated and the drift can't silently come back.
