"""
This module implements the scheduler service for the Marvin application.

It defines the `SchedulerService` class responsible for starting and managing
periodically executed tasks. Tasks (callbacks) are registered via the
`SchedulerRegistry` and are run at specified intervals (minutely, hourly, daily)
using the `repeat_every` decorator from `marvin.services.scheduler.runner`.

The daily tasks have special handling to ensure they run at a specific configured
time of day (UTC).
