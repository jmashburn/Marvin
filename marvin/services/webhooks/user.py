This module defines the `UserWebhook` class, a specific implementation of
`BaseWebhook` within the Marvin application, tailored for user-related webhook events.

It provides a concrete handler that can be registered or used for webhooks
associated with user events, overriding the base `info` method to identify itself.

class UserWebhook(BaseWebhook):
    """
    A webhook handler implementation specific to user-related events.

    This class extends `BaseWebhook` and currently provides a distinct `info`
    method that identifies it as a "User Webhook". This could be used by the
    `WebhookEventListener` to fetch specific data related to users if an event
    of type `EventDocumentType.user` is being processed by a webhook configured
    to use this handler type.

    Other methods like `create`, `update`, `delete` are inherited from `BaseWebhook`
    and will raise `NotImplementedError` if called, indicating that this handler
    might primarily be for informational data retrieval or simple triggers rather
    than full CRUD operations via webhooks for users.

        Provides identifying information for this user-specific webhook type.

        Currently returns a simple string "User Webhook". In a more complex scenario,
        this method might fetch and return specific user-related data based on the
        context (e.g., `self.group_id` or other parameters passed via `**kwargs`
        if the `info` signature were extended).

        Returns:
            str: A string identifying this as a "User Webhook".
