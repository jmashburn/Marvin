    A generic webhook handler implementation.

    This class extends `BaseWebhook` and provides a concrete, albeit simple,
    implementation for the `info` method. It's likely used as a default handler,
    for testing, or as a template for more specific webhook types.

    Other CRUD-like methods (`create`, `update`, `delete`) are inherited from
    `BaseWebhook` and will raise `NotImplementedError` if called, indicating
    that this generic handler does not support those operations by default.
