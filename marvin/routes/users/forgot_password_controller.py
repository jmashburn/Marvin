This module defines FastAPI routes for handling password reset functionalities

It provides public endpoints for users to request a password reset email
(which includes a unique token) and to submit a new password along with
the received token to complete the reset process.

    Initiates the password reset process for a user by sending them an email.

    The email contains a unique, time-sensitive token and a link to the password
    reset page. This endpoint is public and typically called when a user has
    forgotten their password. The email content may be localized based on the
    `accept_language` header.

    Args:
        email_data (ForgotPassword): Pydantic schema containing the `email` of the user
                                     requesting the password reset.
        session (Session): SQLAlchemy database session.
        accept_language (str | None, optional): Preferred language for the reset email,
                                                extracted from the 'Accept-Language' header.
                                                Defaults to None (system default language).

    Returns:
        SuccessResponse: A confirmation response indicating that if the email address
                         is valid and associated with an account, a reset email has been sent.
                         (Actual email sending is handled by the service, which might
                         not immediately confirm success to prevent user enumeration).

    Resets a user's password using a valid password reset token.

    The user provides the token received via email and their new desired password.
    The service layer validates the token (e.g., checks for existence, expiry, usage)
    and, if valid, updates the user's password. This endpoint is public.

    Args:
        reset_data (ResetPassword): Pydantic schema containing the `token` and the
                                    new `password`.
        session (Session): SQLAlchemy database session.

    Returns:
        SuccessResponse: A confirmation that the password has been reset.

    Raises:
        HTTPException (400 Bad Request or other): If the token is invalid, expired,
                                                  or the password update fails, the service
