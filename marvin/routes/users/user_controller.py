"""
This module defines FastAPI controllers related to user management in the Marvin application.

It includes:
- `UserController`: For operations that authenticated users can perform on their
  own profiles, such as retrieving their information, updating their profile,
  and changing their password.

Note: This file contains commented-out sections for `AdminUserController` and
`UserApiTokensController`. These functionalities might be handled in their
dedicated controller files (e.g., `marvin/routes/admin/user_controller.py` and
`marvin/routes/users/api_token_controller.py` respectively) or are pending
implementation/refactoring.
