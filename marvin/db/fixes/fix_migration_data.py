"""
This module provides a framework for applying data fixes after database migrations.

It allows defining "fix" functions that can be run to correct or update data
that might be affected by schema changes or require updates post-migration.
Currently, it includes a `dummy_fix` as a placeholder and a main function
`fix_migration_data` to orchestrate the execution of these fixes.
